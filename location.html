                <p>Our web application is designed to enhance women's safety by providing a range of tools.
                    <br/><strong>New Feature: Mark Locations on Google Maps</strong>
                    <br/>In this feature, you can mark specific locations on the map with flags 
                    such as <strong>"Pickpocket", "No Light", "Robbery", "Eve-teasing" and more.</strong> 
                    These flags allow you to highlight potentially unsafe areas and share that information with your friends. 
                    Your friends can easily see the marks you've added, making it simpler for them to stay informed about the safety of various locations.
                    
                    To access this feature, you need to <strong>register or log in</strong> to your account.</p>
